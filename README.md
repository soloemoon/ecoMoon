# ecoMoon: R package to quickly download, clean, and visualize economic data (WIP)
This package allows for quick extraction, transformation, loading, and plotting of economic data from various sources (currently only FRED supported but more coming soon!).

Currently this package is only availble from GitHub. It can be installed via Hadley's devtools with the following code:

devtools::install_github("soloemoon/ecoMoon")
