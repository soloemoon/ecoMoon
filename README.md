# ecoMoon: R package to quickly download, clean, and visualize economic data (WIP)
This package allows for quick extraction, transformation, loading, and plotting of economic data. This package utilizes FRED data (via the FredR package) to extract data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data API. In addition to Fred data, this package allows for the ETL'ing of data from the BEA and BLS. New data sources are constantly being added!

Currently this package is only availble from GitHub. It can be installed via Hadley's devtools with the following code:

devtools::install_github("soloemoon/ecoMoon")
